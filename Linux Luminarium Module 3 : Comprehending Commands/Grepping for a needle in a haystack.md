# Grepping for a needle in a haystack

### Learning to search for a particular text for a big file

**Flag:** `pwn.college{w9k7iqsV4EE6Xh8w-cs-fyiUUSI.QX3EDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

For this challenge, we were required to search for some particular text from a very big file of a hundred thousand lines.
So, I learned to use the `grep` command to search for that.
 
```
hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
pwn.college{w9k7iqsV4EE6Xh8w-cs-fyiUUSI.QX3EDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. To search for a particular text from a file, we can use the `grep` command.

## References

None.
