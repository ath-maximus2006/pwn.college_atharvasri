# Listing Files

### Learning to list all the files in a directory

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8j8NujpG4nwNWOmcBkskpPPFQg2.QX4IDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

First, i listed all the files in the `/challenge` directory and then, typed the name of the renamed file
to get the flag.

```
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ ls /challenge
21110-renamed-run-30686  DESCRIPTION.md
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ /challenge/21110-renamed-run-30686  DESCRIPTION.md
Yahaha, you found me! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8j8NujpG4nwNWOmcBkskpPPFQg2.QX4IDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
