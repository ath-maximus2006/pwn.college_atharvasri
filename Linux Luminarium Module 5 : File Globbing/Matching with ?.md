# Matching with ?

### Learning the use of ? as an argument for various commands

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8HirH3cB5GmOKDg--UhEMTlsRit.QXyIDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

Here, i used `?` as an argument for the `cd` command whihc took me to the 'challenge' dir..
```
acker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8HirH3cB5GmOKDg--UhEMTlsRit.QXyIDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$
```
