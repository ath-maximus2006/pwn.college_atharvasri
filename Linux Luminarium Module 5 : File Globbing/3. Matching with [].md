# Matching with []

### The application of the [] as an argument

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8gbbqI1UnN80h06YMJJzKMCLYP5.QXzIDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

I used [] as an argument for `/challenge/run` with `File_[absh]` to act as a wildcard.

```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run file_[absh]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{8gbbqI1UnN80h06YMJJzKMCLYP5.QXzIDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. I learned the use of [] argument.
2. [] is a limited version of `?`.

## References

None.
