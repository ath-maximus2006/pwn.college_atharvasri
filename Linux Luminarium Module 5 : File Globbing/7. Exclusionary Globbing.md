# Exclusionary Globbing

### Inverted Globbing - Specifying files that shouldn't be listed

**Flag:** `pwn.college{QJppYH5ysihnoPCcfrTRFSV83rW.QX2IDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

I used the [] argument again to filter out what i don't want to be listed by adding a `!` in front of the string.

```
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [!pwn]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{QJppYH5ysihnoPCcfrTRFSV83rW.QX2IDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. We can use globbing to filter out undesired files by using the '!' symbol.
2. 
## References

None.
