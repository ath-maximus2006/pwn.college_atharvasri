# Mixing Globs

### Putting together previous learned ways to glob

**Flag:** `pwn.college{MgwfacaBTAtTgEc8wx0-l235Nd_.QX1IDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

I used the `*` and '[]' together in an argument to get the job done.

```
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [cep]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{MgwfacaBTAtTgEc8wx0-l235Nd_.QX1IDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. I learned that both `*` and `[]` can be used together.
