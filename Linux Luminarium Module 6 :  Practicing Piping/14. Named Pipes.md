# Nmaed Pipes

### Creating a permanent named pipe file.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{0L1U4fgcdHVGK1_8zl6qN32gfSQ.01MzMDOxwSMyAzNzEzW}`

I used the `mkfifo` command to create a fifo file and redirected it to the given file. Then i opened another
shell and used `cat` command to read the redirected output.

```
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ /challenge/run > /tmp/flag_fifo
You're successfully redirecting /challenge/run to a FIFO at /tmp/flag_fifo!
Bash will now try to open the FIFO for writing, to pass it as the stdout of
/challenge/run. Recall that operations on FIFOs will *block* until both the
read side and the write side is open, so /challenge/run will not actually be
launched until you start reading from the FIFO!
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ cat /tmp/flag_fifo
You've correctly redirected /challenge/run's stdout to a FIFO at
/tmp/flag_fifo! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0L1U4fgcdHVGK1_8zl6qN32gfSQ.01MzMDOxwSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. I learned that we can create our own named pipe files.
2. To access the files, we need to `close` the pipe by runnig the write and read commands together.

## References

None.
