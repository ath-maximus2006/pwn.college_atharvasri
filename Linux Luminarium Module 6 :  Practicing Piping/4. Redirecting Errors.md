# Redirecting Errors

### Saving `errors` by redirecting them to a file

**Flag:** `pwn.college{484ee92MMm_og-N_BpWE-QthjdY.QX3YTN0wSMyAzNzEzW}`
Here, i used the `2>` to redirect the errors from the command to a certain file called `instructions`.
Then i accessed the file using `cat` command.

```
hacker@piping~redirecting-errors:~$ /challenge/run > myflag 2> instructions
hacker@piping~redirecting-errors:~$ cat instructions
