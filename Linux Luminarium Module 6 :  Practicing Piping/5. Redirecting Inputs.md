# Redirecting Inputs

### Learning to take inputs from saved files.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{siLQzE2lwquAiqT_qkW9tJwvDMS.QXwcTN0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

First, i saved the data `COLLEGE` to `PWN` using `>`. Then i passed the required command and took input from `PWN` using `<`.

```
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ echo COLLEGE > PWN
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ /challenge/run < PWN
Reading from standard input...
Correct! You have redirected the PWN file into my standard input, and I read
the value 'COLLEGE' out of it!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{siLQzE2lwquAiqT_qkW9tJwvDMS.QXwcTN0wSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. I learned that we can take/redirect inputs from various already-saved files in the shell.

## References

None.
