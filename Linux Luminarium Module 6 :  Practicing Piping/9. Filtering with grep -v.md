# Filtering with grep -v

### Filtering out data that we don't want

**Flag:** `pwn.college{sstd9_K17SBxZ62SmKqMYkFCKkS.0FOxEzNxwSMyAzNzEzW}`

I used the `|` operator with `grep -v` to filter out all the flags containing the word `DECOY` and get the one real flag.

```
hacker@piping~filtering-with-grep-v:~$ /challenge/run | grep -v DECOY
pwn.college{sstd9_K17SBxZ62SmKqMYkFCKkS.0FOxEzNxwSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. I learned the use of `grep -v` commmand that can be used to filter out unwanted data.

## References

None.
