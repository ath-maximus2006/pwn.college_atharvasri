# Redirecting Output

### Learning to redirect the out of a certain command to some other file

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Ei7LNwHWActXBGEIxyA5tRWuhpO.QX0YTN0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

I used the `>` symbol to redirect the out of the `echo` command to the required file.

```
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{Ei7LNwHWActXBGEIxyA5tRWuhpO.QX0YTN0wSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. Outputs can be redirected to some other files.
2. This can be done with the help of `>` symbols.

## References

None.
