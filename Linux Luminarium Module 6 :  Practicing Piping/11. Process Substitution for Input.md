# Process Substitution for Input

### Learning to take command outputs as inputs

**Flag:** `pwn.college{M1Nmqo8qQu-u5EqcGwqac1-YEZR.0lNwMDOxwSMyAzNzEzW}`

I used the `diff` command and uses `<()` to get inputs from the outputs of the two given commands and got the flags.
```
hacker@piping~process-substitution-for-input:~$ diff <(/challenge/print_decoys) <(/challenge/print_decoys_and_flag)
32a33
> pwn.college{M1Nmqo8qQu-u5EqcGwqac1-YEZR.0lNwMDOxwSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. I learned that we can use command output as inputs too.
2. I can use the diff command to find out the difference between two stdouts.

## References

None.
