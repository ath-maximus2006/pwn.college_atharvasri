Flag : pwn.college{08qlOFkrNhvSiWH7Tx7vM0-uPLe.QX4EDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}
# Grepping Stored Results

### Learning to search through stored output in files.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{08qlOFkrNhvSiWH7Tx7vM0-uPLe.QX4EDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

Here, i first redirected the out to the desired file. Them i accessed the flag using the `grep` command by passing `pwn.college`, since that's how all flags start.
```
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$ /challenge/run > /tmp/data.txt
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : /tmp/data.txt
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /challenge/.data.txt

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /challenge/.data.txt file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called /tmp/data.txt. Checking...

[HINT] File descriptors are inherited from the parent, unless the FD_CLOEXEC is set by the parent on the file descriptor.
[HINT] For security reasons, some programs, such as python, do this by default in certain cases. Be careful if you are
[HINT] creating and trying to pass in FDs in python.

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$ grep Flag /tmp/data.txt
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$ grep pwn.college /tmp/data.txt
pwn.college{08qlOFkrNhvSiWH7Tx7vM0-uPLe.QX4EDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. I learned that we can use Grep command to search through redirected outputs.

## Errors

1. I did a mistake by passsing the string 'Flag' with the  `grep` command. 

## References

None.
