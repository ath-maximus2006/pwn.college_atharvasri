# Writing to Multiple Programs

### using `tee` to copy outputs to commands and use them as inputs

**Flag:** `pwn.college{wk6kU_myxRByFv_r4p2ma1Al8-P.QXwgDN1wSMyAzNzEzW}`

I used the iven command with | pipe operator and tee and copied the output to the two named pipe files for the two given commands.

```
hacker@piping~writing-to-multiple-programs:~$ /challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) >(/challenge/planet)
This secret data must directly and simultaneously make it to /challenge/the and
/challenge/planet. Don't try to copy-paste it; it changes too fast.

Congratulations, you have duplicated data into the input of two programs! Here
is your flag:

```

## What I learned

1. We can use `tee` with commands as well.
