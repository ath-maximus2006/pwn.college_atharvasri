# Duplicating Piped data with tee

### Learning to create an output of the first command during a `pipe` operator to debug etc.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Q4Lc8BJPxVgxcBApzrF4hCmNeJN.QXxITO0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

I used `|` with `tee` to create an output of the stdout from the first command into a file. Then i read trhough this file thorugh `cat`. And then applied the missing argument
to this command along with | and the second command and got the flag.

```
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn | tee pwn_stdout | /challenge/college
Processing...
The input to 'college' does not contain the correct secret code! This code
should be provided by the 'pwn' command. HINT: use 'tee' to intercept the
output of 'pwn' and figure out what the code needs to be.
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ cat pwn_stdout
Usage: /challenge/pwn --secret [SECRET_ARG]

SECRET_ARG should be "Q4Lc8BJP"
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn --secret Q4Lc8BJP | /challenge/college
Processing...
Correct! Passing secret value to /challenge/college...
Great job! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Q4Lc8BJPxVgxcBApzrF4hCmNeJN.QXxITO0wSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. I learned to create a copy of the output for a command even when using the | operator to understand the situation if anything goes wrong.

## References

None.
