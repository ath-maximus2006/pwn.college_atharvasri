# Grepping Live Output

### Learning to use the output of a command directly as an input for another command.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Ue56V6HZJ3IgPBtDbsNP__fecYC.QX5EDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

 I used the given command with the `|` (pipe) operator, to use it as an input for the `grep` command and get the flag.

```
hacker@piping~grepping-live-output:~$ /challenge/run | grep pwn.college
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdout : grep
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /challenge/.data.txt

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /challenge/.data.txt file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to another process. Checking...
[TEST] Performing checks on that process!

[INFO] The process' executable is /nix/store/8b4vn1iyn6kqiisjvlmv67d1c0p3j6wj-gnugrep-3.11/bin/grep.
[INFO] This might be different than expected because of symbolic links (for example, from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3.8).
[INFO] To pass the checks, the executable must be grep.

[PASS] You have passed the checks on the process on the other end of my stdout!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
pwn.college{Ue56V6HZJ3IgPBtDbsNP__fecYC.QX5EDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. I learned that we can skip the redirection step and directly use the output of a command in some other command.

## References

None.
