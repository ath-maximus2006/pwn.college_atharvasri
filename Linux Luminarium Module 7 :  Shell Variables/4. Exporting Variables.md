# Exporting Variables

### Learning to export variables to child shells.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8_a8L6jMpzWXeZe2NfkYvVU5YQx.QXyYTN0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

First, i aasinged the value that is not to be exported and then i used the `export` the second variable and invoked the required command to get the flag.

```
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ COLLEGE=PWN
You've set the COLLEGE variable to the proper value!
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ export PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!
You've set the COLLEGE variable to the proper value!
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ /challenge/run $PWN
CORRECT!
You have exported PWN=COLLEGE and set, but not exported, COLLEGE=PWN. Great
job! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8_a8L6jMpzWXeZe2NfkYvVU5YQx.QXyYTN0wSMyAzNzEzW}
You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!
You've set the COLLEGE variable to the proper value!
```
