# Reading Files

### Learning to read input directly from a file

**Flag:** `pwn.college{sG8qH0hGy72Jw5TnOm4TGWR0QmC.QXwIDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

I used the `read` command and `<` to send the contents of the given file directly to be read as the value of the specified variable.

```
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{sG8qH0hGy72Jw5TnOm4TGWR0QmC.QXwIDO0wSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. I learnt that we can use the contents of a file as input for `read <VAR>`

## References

None.
