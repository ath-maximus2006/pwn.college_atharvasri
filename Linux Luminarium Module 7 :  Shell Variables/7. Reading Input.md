# Reading Input

### Taking Input from user and storing it directly.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8-ZwOF-FHn0yPWq4LGhqHeN68os.QX4cTN0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

 I specified the variable, i wanted the input for, using `read` and then typed `COLLEGE` as the value to be assigned and got the flag.

```
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read -p "INPUT: " PWN
INPUT: COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{8-ZwOF-FHn0yPWq4LGhqHeN68os.QX4cTN0wSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. I learnt that we can take input from the user and store it directly in a variable.

## References
