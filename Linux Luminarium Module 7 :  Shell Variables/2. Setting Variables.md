# Setting Variables

### Learning to assign values to variables

**Flag:** `pwn.college{cqVRKcyHc4bOfKcMl1MJKYE2oTb.QX5UTN0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

I used the `=` symbol to assign a value to the given variable.

```
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{cqVRKcyHc4bOfKcMl1MJKYE2oTb.QX5UTN0wSMyAzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

1. I learnt about setting variables.
2. I lerant that there should be no space between the variable, `=` and the assigned value (var=value).

## References

None.
