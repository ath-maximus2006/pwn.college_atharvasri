Flag : pwn.college{Qsk5_l-w93NZrfntXXXcknrFOqr.QX4cTO0wSMyAzNzEzW}
# Invoke Program by Absolute Path

The challenge asks you to run a program located at the root of the filesystem by giving its absolute path `/pwn` to obtain the flag.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Qsk5_l-w93NZrfntXXXcknrFOqr.QX4cTO0wSMyAzNzEzW}`

I launched the terminal and invoked the program by its absolute path. Programs in the root directory can be executed by specifying the full path starting with `/`.

```
hacker@dojo:~$ /pwn

```

## What I Learned

* How to run a program using an absolute path, e.g., `/pwn`.

## References
