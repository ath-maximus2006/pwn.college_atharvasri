# Using Shell History (up arrow)

The challenge asks you to retrieve a flag that has been injected into your shell history. Use the up arrow key to scroll through previous commands until you find the entry that contains the flag, then run or copy it.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{opmMH8kTtQhrJtq7N0sRA-7i10e.0lNzEzNxwSMyAzNzEzW}`

This level places the flag as a previous command in the history. To get it I opened the terminal and pressed the up arrow key until the required command appeared. Once I saw the command that contained the flag, I ran it or copied the flag from the command line.

## What I Learned

* How to navigate command history with the up and down arrow keys.
* That previous commands can be retrieved, edited, and re-run without retyping them.
* This is useful for repeating long commands or recovering mistakes.

## References

* None
