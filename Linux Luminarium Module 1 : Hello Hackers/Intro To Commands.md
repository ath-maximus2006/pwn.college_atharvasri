# First Command: Hello

The challenge asks you to invoke your first command in the DOJO shell. Specifically, run the `hello` command (Linux is case-sensitive) to obtain the flag.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{goEC3QPZ3-NplSaDvehrd3HzWQr.QX3YjM1wSMyAzNzEzW}`

To solve this level I simply ran the `hello` command at the prompt. The command prints the flag when invoked with the correct name and then returns control to the shell.

```
hacker@dojo:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{goEC3QPZ3-NplSaDvehrd3HzWQr.QX3YjM1wSMyAzNzEzW}
hacker@dojo:~$
```
